# lecture-repo

I learned what a repository is : A collection of files and their associated commit history. 
I also learned how to make a repository on Github, & clone a remote repository from Github onto my local computer. 

Learned how to push my changes in the repo and how the work flow works : 
git status
git add <filename>
git commit -m " " 
git push
